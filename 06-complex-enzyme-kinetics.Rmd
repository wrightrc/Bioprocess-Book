# Complex Enzyme Kinetics

Many enzymes do not simply convert one substrate to a single product. Enzymes such as amylases which are critical to brewing and distilling convert long chains of sugars (starches) into shorter chains and disaccharides. 

## Allosteric Enzymes 

Allosteric enzymes have more than one substrate binding site, or an "effector" binding site in addition to a substrate binding site. An effector can be any biomolecule, that when bound to the enzyme, affects the activity of the enzyme. 

If the effector or substrate has a positive effect on enzyme activity this is called cooperativity.
