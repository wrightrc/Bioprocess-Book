Bioprocess Engineers utilize this intersection to produce these valuable and necessary commodities in a cheaper, less resource and energy intensive, lower risk, and more sustainable way. This is done by harnessing the lifeforms that perform valuable chemical reactions and engineering systems to scale up the production of these valuable chemicals for commercial use. Before we can delve into engineering chemical reactions we must first develop the ability to quantify chemical reactions. 1.1 Stoichometry The stoichiometry of a chemical reaction tells us what chemical species are consumed and formed in a reaction and in what proportions. Stoichiometry is the basis of our ability to quantify a chemical reaction Consider the chemical reaction: \\[ \\require{mhchem} \\require{mhchem}\\ce{Cl2 + C3H6 + 2NaOH -&gt; C3H6O + 2NaCl + H2O} \\] It is important to check that this reaction equation is balanced, and therefore satisfies the law of conservation of matter. We will check that this equation is balanced as a review. Remembering your general chemistry, in order to write a balanced chemical equation the chemical elements (\\(j\\)) must be conserved, i.e. for each chemical compound/species \\(i\\) \\[\\sum_{i} \\nu_i N_{ij} = 0\\] where \\(\\nu_i\\) is the stoichiometric coefficient for each chemical species containing the element and \\(N_{ij}\\) is the number of molecules of the element \\(j\\) in species \\(i\\). Within this equation there is a critical convention: The coefficients of the products of a reaction are positive, and the coefficients of the reactants are negative. So for the reaction above we can make a table for each chemical species and element: \\(\\nu_j N_{ij}\\) \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{Cl2}\\) \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{C3H6}\\) \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{NaOH}\\) \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{C3H6O}\\) \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{NaCl}\\) \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{H2O}\\) \\(\\sum_{i}\\) \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{Cl}\\) -1 * 2 0 0 0 2*1 0 0 \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{C}\\) 0 -1*3 0 1*3 0 0 0 \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{H}\\) 0 -1*6 -2*1 1*6 0 2 0 \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{Na}\\) 0 0 -2*1 0 2*1 0 0 \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{O}\\) 0 0 -2*1 1 0 1 0 You may have used this stoichiometric notation in thermodynamics to calculate the standard Gibbs free energy or standard enthalpy change of a reaction. This balanced stoichiometric equation tells us then that for every mole of \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{Cl2}\\) consumed, one mole of \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{C3H6O}\\) will be formed, as long as there is sufficient \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{C3H6}\\) and \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{NaOH}\\). But how can we figure out if there are sufficient quantities of the other reactants? How can we figure out which reactant is limiting? 1.2 Quantifying the Progress of a Reaction 1.2.1 Extent of Reaction The extent of reaction is a measure of how far a reaction has progressed at any point in time. To define the extent of reaction we will use the example of a simple batch reactor, imagine a beaker containing fixed amounts of chemicals which are reacting. To define how far the reaction has progressed we start by defining the change in each chemical species throughout the reaction. At the start of the reaction there are \\(n_{i0}\\) moles of each \\(i\\) species in our reaction. At time \\(t\\) the number of moles of species \\(i\\) is defined as \\(n_i\\). We can then define the change in species \\(i\\) as \\(\\Delta n_i = n_i - n_{i0}\\). The extent of reaction is a property of the whole reaction not each individual species. So to convert the change in moles of any species, to the extent to which the reaction has progressed, we divide the change in moles of species \\(i\\) by its stoichiometric coefficient, i.e. \\[\\xi = \\Delta n_i/\\nu_i\\] 1.2.1.1 ???Questions??? Is the extent of reaction for reactants positive or negative? Is the extent of reaction for products positive or negative? The extent of reaction is always positive. Be careful about always sticking to the \\(\\text{final} - \\text{initial}\\) convention and check the signs of your stoichiometric coefficients. The extent of reaction can also be defined for continuous (steady state open) systems \\[\\xi = \\Delta \\dot n_i/\\nu_i\\] 1.2.1.2 Limiting Reactant Extent of reaction is how we calculate the limiting reactant. The limiting reactant is the reactant that is completely consumed in the reaction and prevents the reaction from progressing any further. Therefore the limiting reactant, \\(l\\), defines the maximum extent of the reaction, because it is completely consumed in the reaction, i.e. \\[\\xi_{max} = -n_{l0}/\\nu_l\\] We can find the limiting reactant by calculating the extent of reaction for each reactant species if it were completely consumed. The limiting reactant has the lowest extent of reaction, i.e. it runs out first if the reaction goes to completion. In reversible reactions, equilibrium will be reached prior to completion and \\(\\xi\\) will always be less than \\(\\xi_{max}\\). 1.2.2 Fractional Conversion The fraction of the limiting reactant that has been consumed is also frequently used to quantify the progress of a single reaction. Fractional conversion is defined as: \\[x_l = \\frac{n_{l0} - n_l}{n_{l0}} = 1 - \\frac{n_l}{n_l0} \\label{eq:frac-conv}\\] Fractional conversion can also sometimes be specified for certain species in the reaction, e.g. \\(x_A\\). This sometimes done when only one species in the reaction can be measured. For a constant volume/density system conversion can also be defined in terms of concentration. \\[\\frac{C_{A0} - C_{A}}{C_{A0}} = x_A = 1-C_A/C_{A0}\\] \\[\\therefore C_A/C_{A0} = 1-x_A\\] 1.2.3 Multiple Reactions If there are multiple reactions happening we can assign each one an extent of reaction and use these to define generation and consumption terms in our material balances. Let’s walk through an example to demonstrate this. Thiophene (\\(\\ce{C4H4S}\\)) is a problematic contaminant of both biofuels and petroleum because it contains sulfur. A pilot plant for removal of thiophene by hydrodesulfurization has been run with the following results: Species moles fed moles effluent \\(\\ce{C4H4S}\\) 75.3 5.3 \\(\\ce{H2}\\) 410.9 145.9 \\(\\ce{C4H10}\\) 20.1 75.1 \\(\\ce{H2S}\\) 25.7 95.7 The following reactions are proposed to occur: \\[\\ce{C4H4S + 3H2 -&gt;[1] C4H8 + H2S} \\\\ \\ce{C4H8 + H2 -&gt;[2] C4H10}\\] Are the data above consistent with these proposed reactions i.e. do the reactive material balances work out? To answer this we need to write the material balances on each species. We can assume no accumulation in the reactor in this case, so our General Balance simplifies to \\[OUT = IN + GEN - CONS\\] Now we can make a table and fill in each species. Let’s skip the symbolic notation here for simplicity \\(\\ce{C4H4S:}\\) \\[ \\begin{array}{cccccccc} \\text{General:} &amp;\\text{OUT}&amp; = &amp; \\text{IN} &amp; + &amp; \\text{GEN} &amp; - &amp; \\text{CONS} \\\\ \\ce{C4H4S:} &amp; 5.3 &amp;=&amp; 75.3 &amp;&amp;&amp;-&amp; \\xi_1 \\\\ \\ce{H2:}&amp; 145.9 &amp;=&amp; 410.9 &amp;&amp;&amp;-&amp; 3\\xi_1 - \\xi_2 \\\\ \\ce{C4H10:}&amp; \\\\ \\ce{H2S:} \\\\ \\ce{C4H8:} \\end{array} \\] OUT and IN values come directly from the table. GEN and CONS values are written in terms of the extents of reactions. It is particularly difficult to write out the balances in terms of conversions for multiple reactions, this is why we introduce extents of reaction. Fill in the last 3 rows of the table for practice. Now that we have written all of our balances, we can solve for unknowns, the extents of our two reactions. We can do that from the first two species balances above. \\[\\xi_1 = 75.3 - 5.3 = 70\\] \\[\\xi_2 = 410.19 - 3(70) - 145.9 = 55\\] Now to answer the question we need to see if the remaining balances are consistent with these values. If we plug in these values to the other balances are they mathematically correct? If so then the law of conservation of mass is satisfied based on our data and the proposed reactions. How much butene (C4H8) is in the effluent of the reactor? 1.2.3.1 Yield Coefficients A yield coefficient is a fraction consisting of the amount of product formed over the amount of reactant consumed. Thus yield coefficients are kind of like stoichiometric ratios, but they can be written for multiple reactions. They can even be used to describe the “stoichiometry” of enormous numbers of reactions like all of the reactions required for a cell to consume a sugar and produce more cell mass. Yield coefficients (sometimes just called yields) allow us to do simple calculations of the amounts of products formed from some substrate/reactant, or how much reactant is required to form some amount of product. What is the yield coefficient of butane (\\(\\ce{C4H10}\\)) on hydrogen? We would specify this as \\[Y_{\\ce{C4H10}/\\ce{H2}} = \\frac{\\Delta n_{\\ce{C4H10}}}{-\\Delta n_{\\ce{H2}}}\\] Yield coefficients are always expressed as positive values. It is always best practice to carry the species names along with the units when using yields or stoichiometric ratios in calculations. The units of the above yield would be \\[\\frac{\\text{mol } \\ce{C4H10}}{\\text{mol } \\ce{H2}}\\] 1.3 Reaction Rates: Quantifying the Dynamics of a Reaction Reaction rates are simply the rate of consumption of reactants or generation of products. 1.3.1 Species-dependent Reaction Rate To be useful in designing reactors the reaction rate must be an intensive variable—independent of the size of the reactor. The reaction rate is typically defined in terms of one of the reactants or products of the reaction. The reaction rate is defined as: \\[r_i \\equiv \\text{rate of formation of product }i \\left[\\frac{\\text{ (moles }i \\text{ formed)}}{\\text{(unit time)(unit reactor)}}\\right]\\] or \\[-r_i \\equiv \\text{rate of disappearance of reactant }i \\left[\\frac{\\text{ (moles }i \\text{ consumed)}}{\\text{(unit time)(unit reactor)}}\\right]\\] Reaction rates by convention are always positive. We indicate the reaction rate with respect to a reactant by multiplying by \\(-1\\). This allows us to use the stoichiometry of the reaction to convert reaction rates between species in a reaction, for a stoichiometrically-simple reaction, e.g. \\[ r_1/\\nu_1 = r_2/\\nu_2 = r_3/\\nu_3 = ... = r_i/\\nu_i\\] If multiple reactions are taking place the rate of each reaction must be known to calculate the total rate of formation/disappearance of a species: \\[r_i = \\sum_{k=1}^{R}r_{ki}\\] where \\(R\\) is the number of independent reactions taking place and \\(k\\) is the specific reaction. So for example, the following 2 reactions are happening in a batch reactor: \\[\\ce{A -&gt;[1] 2B} \\\\ \\ce{B -&gt;[2] C}\\] The rate of formation of B, then would be the sum of the rate of formation of B from each reaction, but B is a reactant in reaction 2, so this is a negative rate (rate of consumption). \\(r_B = r_{1B} - r_{2B}\\) 1.3.2 Species-independent Reaction Rates We can make the reaction rate independent of the species for which it was calculated, and referenced to the reaction itself, by dividing the species-dependent rate by the stoichiometric coefficient for that species in the reaction. \\[r \\equiv r_i/\\nu_i\\] This form of the reaction rate has the advantage of preventing confusion about the rate for one reactant being different from another, but does require that the chemical equation that the rate describes be defined. For example the value of \\(r\\) would be different for the following two equations \\[\\require{mhchem}\\ce{N_2 + 3H_2 &lt;=&gt; 2NH_3}\\] \\[\\require{mhchem}\\ce{1/2N_2 + 3/2H_2 &lt;=&gt; NH_3}\\] However, \\(r_{N_2}\\) would be the same for the two reactions, and \\(3r_{N_2} = r_{H_2}\\). Fortunately, this species-independent form of the rate equation is rarely used for biochemical reactions. We present it here mostly as a reminder to always check the stoichiometry of the reaction and the units of the rate for consistency, particularly when using data from the literature. This is especially important as for biochemical reactions the symbol \\(v\\) for velocity of reaction instead of \\(r\\) for rate. Velocity is frequently defined in terms of the primary product of the reaction, but always check to make sure, subscripts are rarely used to specify how velocity is defined. 1.3.3 Rate Equations Now that we have defined reaction rates, how do we quantify them? We might suspect, or know from basic chemistry that a reaction is dependent on temperature and the concentration of all of the species participating in the reaction. \\[r_A \\approx f(T, C_i)\\] Based on more than a century of studying chemical kinetics we can lay out some generalizations about chemical reactions to help us understand the general form and properties of reaction rate functions. 1.3.3.1 For single reactions that are essentially irreversible, the effects of temperature and concentration are seperable This can be described mathematically as: \\[-r_A = k(T)f(C_i)\\] Here, \\(k\\), the rate constant is a function of temperature \\(T\\). Most reactions we will deal with as bioprocess engineers are not simple single irreversible reactions, however this generalization is useful in deriving more complicated reaction mechanisms and often provides a useful starting point when designing reactors. 1.3.3.2 The rate constant \\(k\\) follows the Arrhenius equation The Arrhenius equation dictates how typical chemical reaction rates depend on temperature. It has the form \\[k(T) = Ae^{-E/RT}\\] where \\(R\\) is the gas constant, \\(T\\) is the absolute temperature, \\(E\\) is the activation energy, and \\(A\\) is the pre-exponential factor or frequency factor of the reaction. The Arrhenius equation dictates that the rate of a reaction increases exponentially with temperature. On the molecular level temperature reflects the kinetic energy of the molecules within the reactor. The more kinetic energy the molecules in a reactor have, i.e. the higher the temperature, the more likely they are to collide, or fluctuate, in the correct orientation to undergo the reaction. Unfortunately, enzymes—the biological catalysts—are polymers held in their catalytic conformation by non-covalent interactions, which are also sensitive to increases in kinetic energy. At high temperatures enzymes will unfold in a process called thermal denaturation. This leads to a temperature optimum for enzymatic reactions which is typified by the graph below. As temperature increases so does the enzyme activity and rate of reaction, but eventually the enzyme begins to unfold and the activity drops. temperature &lt;- seq(0, 80, 0.1) A &lt;- 10000 E &lt;- 1000 #(kJ/mole) R &lt;- 8.314 #(J/mole/K) K_eq &lt;- 2e-04 reaction_rate &lt;- A * exp(-E/R/temperature)/(1 + K_eq * (R * temperature)^6) data &lt;- tibble(temperature, reaction_rate) require(ggplot2) ggplot(data = data, mapping = aes(x = temperature, y = reaction_rate)) + geom_line() We will describe this behavior mathematically later on, when we derive the rate equation for enzymes. 1.3.3.3 \\(f(C_i)\\) decreases as the concentrations of the reactants decrease For a given temperature the rate of a reaction will decrease as the concentrations of the reactants decrease. This generalization again is true for most elementary reactions, but is violated in many enzymatic (and other catalytic) reactions, where extremely high substrate concentrations can inhibit some enzymes. We will also discuss this behavior while deriving the rate equations for enzymes. 1.3.3.4 \\(f(C_i)\\) describes the order of the reaction for each species This generalization dictates that \\(f(C_i)\\) can be written as the product of all species raised to their “order” in the reaction. \\[f(C_i) \\approx \\prod_{i} C_i^{\\alpha_i} \\] where \\(\\alpha_i\\) is the order of the reaction for species \\(i\\). The order of reaction generally ranges from -2 to 2 (fractional values are permissible). The summation \\(\\sum_i \\alpha_i\\) is referred to as the overall order of reaction. The order of the reaction for a species reflects the sensitivity of the rate of reaction to a change in concentration of species \\(i\\). If \\(\\alpha_i = 0\\) then the reaction rate is unaffected by the concentration of \\(i\\). If \\(\\alpha_i &lt; 0\\) then the reaction rate is slowed—or inhibited—by \\(i\\). Rate equations which obey this behavior are called power-law rate equations. These equations are grounded in thermodynamics governing molecular collisions between reactants and are often a useful starting point for analysis of kinetic data. Using a power law rate equation to describe the reaction: \\[\\require{mhchem}\\ce{(-\\nu_A)A + (-\\nu_B)B -&gt; \\nu_CC + \\nu_DD}\\] we would propose that \\[f(C_i) = C_A^{\\alpha_A}C_B^{\\alpha_B}C_C^{\\alpha_C}C_D^{\\alpha_D}\\] The reaction orders cannot be determined from the stoichiometry of a reaction, i.e. \\(\\alpha_i \\ne -\\nu_i\\). There are many ways to write a balanced stoichiometric equation for a reaction, the coefficients can be multiplied by any number. The reaction order reflects the actual behavior and mechanism of the reaction. We cannot assume to know which balanced equation reflects the mechanism, but we can hypothesize a mechanism and check if kinetic data fits. We will do this in a later section. In the case that the reaction orders match the stoichiometry of the reaction as written, this reaction is called elementary. Elementary reactions are critical the development of reaction mechanisms and kinetics. We will discuss elementary reactions more in the next section. Once again, for enzymatic reactions, this generalization does not hold. We will soon see enzymatic reactions are more representative of multiple reactions. This generalization may hold for the individual reactions comprising the enzymatic mechanism. But for the reaction as a whole, we will soon see, the order of reaction varies with substrate concentration. 1.3.3.5 For reversible reactions, the net rate is the difference between the forward and reverse reactions \\[-r_{A,net} = -r_{A,f}-r_{A,r}\\] Here \\(-r_{A,net}\\) is the total rate at which the reaction proceeds and species A is a reactant as the chemical equation is written. The reaction is moving forward, if \\(-r_{A,net}\\) is positive, because the rate of consumption of A in the forward reaction, \\(-r_{A,f}\\), is greater than the rate of formation of A by the reverse reaction, \\(r_{A,r}\\). Don’t forget the convention that rates of reaction are positive and the sign is determined by the stoichiometry of the reaction. Based on this generalization we can derive the equilibrium expression for a reversible reaction. At equilibrium the net rate of reaction is 0 and we can write out the rates of the forward and reverse reactions according to the order of reaction in each species. \\[0 = -r_{A,f} - r_{A,r} = k_f \\prod_i C_i^{\\alpha_{f,i}} - k_r \\prod_i C_i^{\\alpha_{r,i}}\\] Rearranging we define the the equilibrium constant, \\[ K_{eq}^C = \\frac{k_f}{k_r} = \\prod_i C_i^{(\\alpha_{r,i} - \\alpha{f,i})}\\] This was derived completely from the principles of kinetics. An equilibrium constant can also be derived via thermodynamics. As you might remember from thermodynamics: \\[K_{eq} = \\prod_i a_i^{\\nu_i}\\] where \\(a_i\\) is the activity (or “effective concentration”) of species \\(i\\). This expression for the equilibrium constant depends on the way the stoichiometric coefficients and thus the way the chemical equation is written. For a typical aqueous reaction we can write this equation in terms of concentration \\[K_{eq}^C=\\prod_iC_i^{\\nu_i}\\] Comparing the thermodynamic and kinetic definitions of \\(K_{eq}^C\\) we can see potential for inconsistency depending on how our chemical equation is written. This implies that in order to be thermodynamically consistent we must define the equilibrium constant based on a single balanced chemical equation. By setting the two versions of the equilibrium constant equal, we can define the condition for this correct equation. \\[\\nu_i = \\alpha_{r,i} - \\alpha_{f,i}\\] Simply, the stoichiometric coefficients must be equal to the order of the total reaction. 1.4 Elementary reactions The above statement defines an elementary reaction, i.e. the order of the forward reaction with respect to species i is equal to the number of molecules of species i participating in each individual reaction. The same is true for the reverse reaction. So for the simple example reaction \\[ \\require{mhchem}\\ce{2A &lt;=&gt; B} \\] the rate of the forward reaction is given by \\(-r_{A,f} = k_f C_A^2\\), and the rate of the reverse reaction \\(r_{A,r} = k_r C_B\\). Combining the two rate equations we find the net rate of disappearance of A is \\(-r_{A,net}=k_f C_A^2 - k_r C_B\\). In these equation the rate constants are defined in terms of A so the units of \\(k_f\\) are (volume/mole A-time) and the units of \\(k_r\\) are (mole A/mole B-time). Unfortunately, the units first order rate constants are often written just as (time-1). 1.4.0.1 ???Questions??? How would you write the net rate of formation of B? Using stoichiometry, \\(r_B = \\frac{1}{2}(-r_A)\\). Similarly the rate constants can be rewritten in terms of B. 1.4.1 Properties of Elementary Reactions What assumptions can we make to help us propose elementary reactions? An elementary reaction—a single-step, molecular level event—must be simple. It likely only involves two molecules, as termolecular collisions are very unlikely, and such collisions happening in the correct orientation are even less likely. We can also assume very few bonds will be formed or broken in a single step. Elementary reactions cannot involve fractional molecules. Elementary reactions must obey the principle of microscopic reversibility. Microscopic reversibility means that the reaction must follow the same mechanism in the forward and reverse directions. This means that an elementary reaction must be elementary in both directions. With this framework for writing elementary reactions we will in Chapter 4 begin deriving mechanisms and rate equations for more complex reactions, which are actually series of multiple elementary reactions. For now we will assume all of the reactions we are dealing with are elementary, unless we are given a rate equation, and we will begin to examine the kinetics of reactions in ideal reactors. "],["02-ideal-reactors.html", "2 Ideal Reactors 2.1 Batch Reactors 2.2 Continuous-stirred tank reactors 2.3 Plug-flow reactors 2.4 Desigining continuous flow reactors", " 2 Ideal Reactors Before jumping into more complex kinetics we will first discuss chemical reactors for simple, elementary reactions. This will give us an understanding of what different reaction orders mean and how reversibility affects dynamics. We will also gain and understanding of different chemical reactors and how reactor choice can effect the reaction outcome. For any reactor we can consider a small control volume \\(dV\\), and examine the rate of generation of species \\(i\\) in that control volume: \\[G_i = \\iiint_V r_idV\\] For open systems, e.g. continuous flow reactors we will have some flow rate into and out of this volume element. Remembering your basic material balances: \\[\\text{Rate In - Rate Out + Rate of Generation = Rate of Accumulation}\\] \\[F_{i0} - F_i + G_i = \\frac{dN_i}{dt}\\] Now let’s consider three types of ideal reactors that this generalized control volume could be in. 2.1 Batch Reactors In most cases, examination of a chemical or biochemical reaction will begin with a small scale batch reactor. An ideal batch reactor is defined as a fixed volume, with no flow in or out, that is well mixed such that concentration and temperature are uniform throughout the volume. The concentration and temperature can vary overtime as the reaction proceeds, but typically some temperature-control mechanism will be applied such that the reactor can be considered isothermal. For batch reactors \\(F_{i0} = F_i = 0\\), such that the rate of generation of species \\(i\\) becomes: \\[G_i = \\iiint_V r_idV = \\frac{dN_i}{dt}\\] Since perfect mixing renders \\(r_i\\) independent of position integration is simple yielding \\[r_i =\\frac{1}{V} \\frac{dN_i}{dt}\\] This equation is called the design equation for a batch reactor. We can substitute \\(r_i\\) for the overall rate equation for any reaction or multiple reactions, and if we can separate the variables dependent on species \\(i\\) and time, we can solve this equation to yield an expression for the number of moles of species \\(i\\) versus time. We can also write this design equation in terms of extent of reaction, as extent of reaction, \\(\\xi = \\Delta N_i / \\nu_i\\). \\[r_i = \\frac{\\nu_i}{V} \\frac{d\\xi}{dt}\\] Additionally for single reactions it is sometimes useful to write the design equation in terms of the fraction of the limiting reactant, \\(l\\) that has been consumed, or fractional conversion, \\(x_l\\). In this case the design equation is \\[-r_l = \\frac{N_{l0}}{V} \\frac{dx_l}{dt}\\] If volume is constant, we can also write any of these equations in terms of concentration as \\(C_i = N_i / V\\), e.g. \\[r_i =\\frac{dC_i}{dt}\\] If there is a catalyst or enzyme in the reactor we can also replace the volume of the reactor with the mass of the catalyst in the reactor in any of these equations. Solving these differential equations will provide us with an equation for the amount of species \\(i\\) in the reactor at any given time during the reaction. This will then allow us to calculate the amount of time or reactor volume necessary to run a reaction to achieve the desired quantity of product. Let’s do some example calculations. 2.1.1 First Order Reaction Example Consider a liquid phase reaction \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{A -&gt; B}\\) that is elementary, therefore the rate equation can be written as \\(-r_A = r_B = k_1C_A\\). How long must the reactor be run in order for 70% of A to be converted to B if \\(k_1 = 0.05 \\text{ min}^{-1}\\) and \\(C_{A0} = 5 \\text{ M}\\)? Our goal is to find the time required for 70% of A to be consumed. This indicates that we should set this problem up in terms of fractional conversion or extent of reaction. So our design equation will simplify to \\[r_A = \\frac{dC_A}{dt} = \\frac{d[C_{A0}(1-x_A)]}{dt} = \\frac{d(C_{A0}-C_{A0}x_A)}{dt} = 0-C_{A0}\\frac{dx_A}{dt}\\] \\[-r_A = C_{A0}\\frac{dX_A}{dt}\\] We know what the rate of consumption of A is since the reaction is elementary, so we can plug this relation in for \\(-r_A\\), and also write \\(C_A\\) in terms of fractional conversion, \\(C_{A0}(1-x_A)\\). \\[k_1C_{A0}(1-x_A) = C_{A0} \\frac{dx_A}{dt}\\] We can then separate variables \\[k_1dt = \\frac{dx_A}{(1-x_A)}\\] and finally integrate \\[k_1\\int_0^tdt = \\int_0^{0.7}\\frac{1}{(1-x_A)} dx_A\\] to yield \\[t = \\frac{-[\\ln(1-0.7)-\\ln(1)]}{k_1}\\] So in this case 24.08 minutes are required to achieve 70% conversion. What do the dynamics of this reaction look like over time? Let’s solve the general form of the integral to find out. \\[k_1\\int_0^tdt = \\int_0^{x_A}\\frac{1}{(1-x_A)} dx_A\\] \\[t = \\frac{-\\ln(1-x_A)}{k_1} \\] \\[e^{-k_1t} = 1-x_A\\] \\[x_A = 1-e^{-k_1t}\\] Now we can plot this relationship. k_1 &lt;- 0.05 t &lt;- seq(0, 100, 0.1) x_A &lt;- 1 - exp(-k_1 * t) require(tidyverse) require(magrittr) data &lt;- tibble(t, x_A) ggplot(data = data, aes(x = t, y = x_A)) + geom_line() + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1)) As we calculated we would need to run the reaction for ~24 minutes to achieve 70% conversion. 2.1.1.1 ???Questions??? Does the reaction ever reach 100% conversion? No, it asymptotically approaches it. What do the concentrations of A and B look like over time? For this let’s make a stoichiometric table to help us keep everything straight Species Initial Concentration Concentration at t=t A \\(C_{A0}\\) \\(C_{A0}(1-x_A)\\) B \\(0\\) \\(C_{A0}x_A\\) Now we can add these concentrations to our plot.

What would the above plot look like if the reaction were zero order? E.g. if the reaction was \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{ A -&gt; B }\\) and the rate equation was \\(-r_A = k_1\\) The design equation for a zero order batch reaction simplifies to \\(k_1 = C_{A0} \\frac{dx_A}{dt}\\). Integrating this yields \\(x_A = k_1t\\). Graphing this equation as above yields x_A &lt;- k_1 * t require(tidyverse) require(magrittr) data &lt;- tibble(t, x_A) C_A &lt;- C_A0 * (1 - data$x_A) C_B &lt;- C_A0 * data$x_A data &lt;- cbind(data, C_A, C_B) data %&lt;&gt;% gather(C_A, C_B, key = &quot;Species&quot;, value = &quot;Concentration&quot;) ggplot(data = data, aes(x = t, y = Concentration, color = Species)) + geom_line() + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 5), xlim = c(0, 20)) This plot is only valid for the window of time for which \\(C_A\\) is positive, as concentrations cannot be negative. To truly represent zero order reactions across indefinite times a discontinuous function must be used. 2.1.2 Second-order Reaction Example 2.1.2.1 ???Questions??? What would this plot look like if it were second order? E.g. if the reaction was \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{ 2A -&gt; B }\\) and the rate equation was \\(-r_A = k_1C_A^2\\) In this case the design equation simplifies to \\(k_1C_{A0}(1-x_A)^2 = \\frac{dx_A}{dt}\\). \\[\\int_0^tk_1C_{A0}dt = \\int_0^{x_A}\\frac{dx_A}{(1-x_A)^2}\\] \\[k_1C_{A0}t = \\frac{1}{1-x_A} - 1\\] \\[ 1 - x_A = \\frac{1}{k_1C_{A0}t + 1}\\] \\[ x_A = 1 - \\frac{1}{k_1C_{A0}t + 1}\\] Graphing this equation as above yields x_A &lt;- 1 - 1/(k_1 * C_A0 * t + 1) require(tidyverse) require(magrittr) data &lt;- tibble(t, x_A) C_A &lt;- C_A0 * (1 - data$x_A) C_B &lt;- C_A0 * data$x_A data &lt;- cbind(data, C_A, C_B) data %&lt;&gt;% gather(C_A, C_B, key = &quot;Species&quot;, value = &quot;Concentration&quot;) ggplot(data = data, aes(x = t, y = Concentration, color = Species)) + geom_line() 2.1.3 Reversible first-order reaction example What about if this were first-order and reversible? \\[\\require{mhchem}\\ce{ A &lt;=&gt; B }\\] \\[-r_A = k_fC_A - k_rC_B\\] Because reversible reactions are actually multiple reactions we cannot use fractional conversion or extent of reaction to measure this reaction, we will just use concentrations. Let’s make a stoichiometric table to start in terms of reactant A. Species Initial Concentration Concentration at t=t A \\(C_{A0}\\) \\(C_A\\) B \\(0\\) \\(C_{A0}-C_A\\) Now we can rewrite the rate equation based on this table. \\[-r_A = k_fC_A - k_r(C_{A0}-C_A)\\] And so the design equation (material balance) is \\[\\frac{dC_A}{dt} = k_fC_A - k_r(C_{A0}-C_A)\\] \\[\\int_0^{C_A}\\frac{dC_A}{(k_f + k_r)C_A - k_rC_{A0}} = \\int_0^tdt \\] Integrating and solving for \\(C_A\\) we get: \\[C_A = \\frac{k_fC_{A0}e^{-(k_f+k_r)t} + C_{A0}k_r}{k_f+k_r}\\] Now we can plot this assuming the same conditions (\\(k_f = 0.05\\text{ min}^{-1}\\) and \\(C_{A0} = 5\\text{ M}\\)) as above, and we can vary the ratio of \\(k_f/k_r\\). C_A0 &lt;- 5 #M k_f &lt;- 0.05 #min kf_kr &lt;- c(10, 1, 0.1) k_r &lt;- k_f/kf_kr require(tidyverse) require(magrittr) # now we are going to need to apply our C_A # calculation over each of the k_r values to do # this we will make C_A a function C_A &lt;- function(k_f, C_A0, k_r, t) { (k_f * C_A0 * exp(-(k_f + k_r) * t) + C_A0 * k_r)/(k_f + k_r) } # and make a table of all combinations of times and # k_r&#39;s data &lt;- crossing(k_r, t) data %&lt;&gt;% add_column(k_f, C_A0, .before = TRUE) # now apply this function over all values of k_r # and t data %&lt;&gt;% mutate(C_A = unlist(pmap(., C_A))) data$C_B &lt;- C_A0 - data$C_A data %&lt;&gt;% gather(C_A, C_B, key = &quot;Species&quot;, value = &quot;Concentration&quot;) data$kf_kr &lt;- data$k_f/data$k_r ggplot(data = data, aes(x = t, y = Concentration, color = Species, linetype = as.factor(kf_kr))) + geom_line() 2.2 Continuous-stirred tank reactors Continuous-stirred tank reactors, or CSTRs, are just like batch reactors except with continuous feed and effluent streams. Ideal mixing is still in effect equalizing temperature and concentration across the contents of the reactor. So to adapt the general equations for a CSTR we simply keep all terms: \\[F_{i0} - F_i + r_iV = \\frac{dN_i}{dt}\\] If assumptions such as constant volume or a single reaction are valid we can similarly simplify this equation to be in terms of concentrations or fractional conversion and extent of reaction, respectively. It is always best to start with the general design equation and walk through each assumption to simplify it, instead of jumping straight to a simplified version without fully assessing each assumption. For CSTRs the rates of reaction are defined at the effluent conditions, which because of perfect mixing are equivalent to the reaction conditions in the entire reactor. For continuous flow reactors we need to define a quantity that reflects how long the reactants spend in the reactor. Most often a quantity called space time is used. Space time is related to the average time that any unit fluid spends in the reactor. Space time at inlet conditions is defined as \\[\\tau_0 = V/v_0\\] where \\(v_0\\) is the inlet volumetric flowrate. Space time provides an analagous metric to real time in a batch reactor. If a batch reaction is run for a longer time more reactants will be converted to product, and if a continuous reactor is run at higher space time, more reactants will be converted to product in the effluent. As \\(F_{i0} = C_{i0}v_0\\), for constant volume reactions, that is when fluid density is constant throughout the reaction, the design equation can be written in terms of space time \\[\\tau_0 = \\frac{C_{i0}x_i}{r_i}\\] Also analagous to batch reactors, catalyst or enzyme weight can also be swapped for reactor volume in the CSTR design equations and definitions of space time. In these cases the catalysts or enzymes are often immobilized on polymeric beads that can easily be filtered from the effluent stream. 2.3 Plug-flow reactors Alternatively enzyme loaded beads could be packed into a porous bed and reactants could be flowed through this bed. This type of reactor is called a plug-flow reactor. However there does not have to be a packed bed in the reactor at all, you can imagine a pipe with fluid flowing through it and a reaction occuring in that fluid. The further along the length of the pipe the fluid is, the further along the reaction is within that fluid. You might have intuited from that last statement that unlike in batch and continuous stirred tank reactors, in plug-flow reactors the reaction rate varies with position In order to be an ideal plug flow reactor, two assumptions must be met. 1. There is no mixing in the direction of flow. We can imagine this as little discs or “plugs” of fluid moving through the reactor in a single file line, like miniature batch reactors moving through the reactor. 2. There is no variation in temperature or concentration normal to the direction of flow. I.e. each of the plugs is uniform. For a real reactor to approximate an ideal reactor, the flow must be highly turbulent. For a plug flow reactor (PFR) our material balance simplifies to \\[F_{i0} - F_i + \\iiint_V r_i dV = 0\\] As we said before \\(r_i\\) varies along the length of the reactor and therefore we need to come up with a strategy to solve this integral. One strategy is to choose a control volume \\(dV\\) such that \\(r_i\\) does not vary within \\(dV\\). So according to our definition of an ideal plug-flow reactor, each “plug” would be a perfect control volume becasue the concentration and therefore rate of reaction are uniform across this volume perpendicular to flow. Rewriting our material balance across this control volume: \\[F_i - (F_i + dF_i) + r_i dV = 0\\] So our design equation for a PFR is \\[dV = \\frac{dF_i}{r_i}\\] Just as with CSTRs, we can define PFRs in terms of space time and concentration. \\[d\\tau_0 = C_{A0} \\frac{dx_A}{-r_A}\\] 2.4 Desigining continuous flow reactors When designing continuous chemical and biochemical reactors we are concerned with the volume of the reactor and flow rate required to meet our production goals. Frequently, a visual representation of the reaction is used to aid in these design decisions for continuous reactors. To derive this visual representation we examine the design equations for a CSTR and PFR. \\[\\text{CSTR: } \\frac{V}{F_{A0}} = \\frac{x_{A}}{-r_A} \\] \\[\\text{PFR: } \\frac{V}{F_{A0}} = \\int_0^{x_A}\\frac{dx_{A}}{-r_A} \\] Now if we plot \\(1/(-r_A)\\) vs \\(x_A\\), the ratio of the reactor volume to the flow rate for a CSTR is the rectangle where the desired fractional conversion intersects the reaction rate. for a first-order, isothermal reaction, this looks like the following. k_1 &lt;- 0.05 C_A0 &lt;- 5 #M t &lt;- seq(0, 100, 0.1) x_A &lt;- 1 - exp(-k_1 * t) require(tidyverse) require(magrittr) data &lt;- tibble(t, x_A) data$nr_A &lt;- k_1 * (C_A0) * (1 - data$x_A) ggplot(data = data, aes(x = x_A, y = 1/nr_A)) + geom_line() + annotate(geom = &quot;rect&quot;, xmin = 0, xmax = 0.9, ymin = 0, ymax = 1/data$nr_A[min(which(round(data$x_A, 3) == 0.9))], alpha = 0.5) The shaded area in this plot represents the size, \\(V\\) to flow rate \\(F_{A0}\\) ratio of the CSTR required to achieve 90% conversion. Looking at the PFR equation we can see that instead of a rectangle the \\(V/F_{A0}\\) ratio is represented by the area under the curve. ggplot(data = data, aes(x = x_A, y = 1/nr_A)) + geom_line() + annotate(geom = &quot;rect&quot;, xmin = 0, xmax = 0.9, ymin = 0, ymax = 1/data$nr_A[min(which(round(data$x_A, 3) == 0.9))], alpha = 0.5) + geom_area(mapping = aes(x = ifelse(x_A &gt;= 0 &amp; x_A &lt;= 0.9, x_A, 0)), fill = &quot;red&quot;, alpha = 0.5) + ylim(c(0, 600)) So given a constant flowrate between the two a PFR reactor will be significantly smaller than a CSTR for the same reaction. 2.4.0.1 ???Questions??? Explain qualitatively why a CSTR needs a larger volume to achieve the same conversion? Hint: what is the average reaction rate in a CSTR vs a PFR? In a CSTR the reaction rate is always constant as the entire volume is always well mixed. As soon as reactants enter the reactor they are diluted to the effluent conditions, which determine the reaction rate throughout the whole reactor. This dilution does not happen In a PFR, so reactants can enter the reactor at a much higher concentration and therefore the reaction can occur at a much higher initial rate. As the reactants move through the reactor they gradually approach the concentration at which the same reaction would be conducted in a CSTR, finally reaching this concentration as the reach the end of the reactor.

Here, we will make use of this concept to make mathematical models quantifying the kinetics (or reaction rate equations) of complex chemical reactions as well as simple and complex enzymatic reaction. In later chapters we will also apply the ideas developed here to model cells growing in a bioreactor. But before we do that let’s discuss some properties of elementary reactions. What assumptions can we make to help us propose elementary reactions? What arethe rules/properties of elementary reactions? An elementary reaction—a single-step, molecular level event—must be simple. It likely only involves two molecules, as termolecular collisions are very unlikely, and such collisions happening in the correct orientation are even less likely. We can also assume very few bonds will be formed or broken in a single step. Elementary reactions cannot involve fractional molecules. Elementary reactions must obey the principle of microscopic reversibility. Microscopic reversibility means that the reaction must follow the same mechanism in the forward and reverse directions. This means that an elementary reaction must be elementary in both directions. 3.1.1 Example of an elementary reaction As an example of an elementary reaction let’s consider the decomposition of ozone: \\[ \\require{mhchem}\\ce{O3 -&gt; O2 + O^.} \\] In reality, ozone does not decompose spontaneously, ozone collides with an dioxygen and the energy of this collision drives decomposition. Thus the reaction written above is not elementary, because it is not written exactly how the reaction happens at the molecular level. We can write the elementary reaction as: \\[ \\require{mhchem}\\ce{O3 + O2 -&gt; O2 + O2 + O^.} \\] This equation and that above are both stoichiometrically correct, but the later equation describes the elementary reaction. How do we know this is the elementary reaction? From the rate equation. Fitting experimental data on the decomposition of ozone to the equation for the elementary reaction, \\(-r_{O_3} = kC_{O_3}C_{O_2}\\), yields a much better fit than \\(-r_{O_3} = kC_{O_3}\\). We will discuss fitting reaction data to rate equations later on. This iterative process of hypothesizing elementary reactions, based on plausible reaction mechanisms, and fitting experimental data to rate equations derived from these elementary reactions is the basis of chemical and biochemical kinetics. With this framework for writing elementary reactions in place we can now begin deriving mechanisms and rate equations for more complex reactions, which are actually series of multiple elementary reactions. Let’s look at another more complex example of how a stoichiometrically simple reaction can be broken down into elementary reactions by hypothesizing a mechanism. 3.2 Elementary Reactions Provide Feasible Mechanisms Most seemingly simple reactions are not elementary as written but can be broken down into a sequence of elementary reactions. Take for example the Haber-Bosch process, by which most nitrogen for fertilizer is fixed from the atmosphere. \\[ \\require{mhchem}\\ce{N2 + 3H2 &lt;=&gt; 2NH3} \\] 3.2.0.1 ???Questions??? How many molecules are involved in the forward and reverse reactions? How many bonds are formed/broken in the forward and reverse reactions? Is this reaction likely elementary as written? Why or why not? In the forward reaction 4 species are required to interact simultaneously, which is very unlikely. In the reverse reaction only two species must interact. In the forward reaction 4 bonds must be broken and 6 bonds must be formed, and the opposite is true for the reverse. No, this reaction is not likely elementary as written as the complex interactions and bond rearrangments are highly unlikely in a single step. So how does this reaction happen? The Haber-Bosch process relies on a iron catalyst, which facilitates much of this bond breaking and forming by allowing hydrogen and nitrogen species to interact with the catalyst. Let’s call the catalyst here \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{S}\\) for solid catalyst. \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{S^*}\\) will represent a open binding site on the catalyst surface. Now let’s write elementary reactions that may constitute a mechanism for the Haber-Bosch process. Initially \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{H2}\\) and \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{N2}\\) will adsorb onto the catalyst surface. \\[ \\require{mhchem}\\ce{H2 + 2S^* &lt;=&gt; 2H-S^*} \\] \\[ \\require{mhchem}\\ce{N2 + 2S^* &lt;=&gt; 2N-S^*} \\] These forward reactions appear to involve three species, however as our catalyst is solid \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{2S^*}\\) act as essentially a single species. Now to form ammonia these adsorbed species must react. \\[ \\require{mhchem}\\ce{ N-S^* + H-S^* &lt;=&gt; NH-S^* + S^*} \\] \\[ \\require{mhchem}\\ce{ NH-S^* + H-S^* &lt;=&gt; NH2-S^* + S^*} \\] \\[ \\require{mhchem}\\ce{ NH2-S^* + H-S^* &lt;=&gt; NH3-S^* + S^*} \\] And finally the ammonia must desorb from the surface. \\[ \\require{mhchem}\\ce{NH3-S^* &lt;=&gt; NH3 + S^*} \\] This proposed mechanism is as simple as possible. The final desorbtion step may happen essentially simultaneously with the final \\(\\require{mhchem}\\ce{N-H}\\) bond formation. We may be able to test this hypothesis with kinetic data or assess under what conditions this assumption might be fair once we have derived a rate equation. But before we derive a rate equation, we should check that the stoichiometry of this series of reactions is equivalent to the complete Haber-Bosch reaction stoichiometry. We can also write the above balanced chemical reactions as equations in a similar way to how we made a stoichiometric table which can be helpful in dealing with multiple reactions in parallel or series. \\[\\sum_i \\nu_i A_i = 0\\] where \\(A_i\\) is each chemical species \\(i\\) participating in the reaction, and \\(\\nu_i\\) is the stoichiometric coefficient of species i. We can write the above reactions in this form and then sum these equations to determine the net overall reaction. \\[\\require{mhchem}\\ce{ - 3H2 - 6S^* + 6H-S^* = 0} \\] \\[ \\require{mhchem}\\ce{- N2 - 2S^* + 2N-S^* = 0} \\] \\[ \\require{mhchem}\\ce{ - 2N-S^* - 2H-S^* + 2NH-S^* + 2S^* = 0} \\] \\[ \\require{mhchem}\\ce{ - 2NH-S^* - 2H-S^* + 2NH2-S^* + 2S^* = 0} \\] \\[ \\require{mhchem}\\ce{- 2NH2-S^* - 2H-S^* + 2NH3-S^* + 2S^* = 0} \\] \\[ \\require{mhchem}\\ce{- 2NH3-S^* + 2NH3 + 2S^* = 0} \\] We have to multiply these equations to match the stoichiometry of the overall reaction, but in the end you see that the catalyst sites will cancel out along with the other intermediate species yielding the overall net reaction. \\[\\require{mhchem}\\ce{ - N2 - 3H2 + 2NH3 = 0 }\\] Now that we have a mechanism of elementary reactions that is consistent with the overall reaction, we can write reaction rates for each species in terms of the formation or consumption of that species in each elementary reaction. Then we can solve this set of equations for the rate of the overall reaction in terms of whichever species we’d like.
